# buildspace Store on Solana Pay Project - Ollivanders Wand shop
Solana Pay is a new, open, and free-to-use payments framework built on Solana — the world’s most performant web3 ecosystem. Solana Pay is built for immediate transactions, fees that are fractions of a penny, and a net-zero environmental impact - https://solanapay.com/

This project is an online version of the fictional store that sells wands from Harry Potter using Solana Pay.
